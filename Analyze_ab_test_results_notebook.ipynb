The probability test for all 3 results was not enough to determine the contrast between both pages. For this reason, we performed an A/B test and regression. The idea here was to check if it satisfied the null or alternative hypothesis described previously. Nevertheless, we failed to reject the null hypothesis. This shows that values dont show a substantial difference in the conversion rates  for treatment and control. \n",
